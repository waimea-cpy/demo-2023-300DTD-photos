A project that uses a **relational DB** linked to a **web UI** using **PHP** to allow users to create account, upload images, add reviews to images, etc.

The UI is mobile-friendly and makes use of [Simple CSS](https://github.com/waimea-cpy/simple-css) to get the UI looking good quickly.

It also uses the [Waimea College PHP Library](https://github.com/waimea-cpy/php-library) for various DB and misc. tasks
